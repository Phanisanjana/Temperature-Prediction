## Project Title: Temperature Prediction

### Overview
In this project, I will predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. I will begin by downloading a dataset of local weather, which you can customize for your specific location. Then, I will proceed to clean the data and prepare it for machine learning. I will develop a system for making historical predictions and subsequently enhance the model's accuracy by introducing additional predictors. Finally, I will conclude the project by explaining how to make predictions for the next day.

### Project Steps
#### 1. Download Weather Data
  Retrieve the historical weather dataset.
#### 2 Data Cleaning and Visualization
  Prepare and visualize the data for analysis.
#### 3 Create a Testing Framework
  Set up a framework for testing the predictive model.
#### 4 Improve Model Accuracy
  Enhance the accuracy of the predictive model by incorporating additional factors.
